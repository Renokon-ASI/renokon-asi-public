Renokon ASI - The Operating System of Humanity. A singular mission to achieve Artificial Super Intelligence by 2035 to compress the next 10,000 years of human civilization progress within the next 100 years. To ensure the survivability of humanity for the next billions of years, to make sure one catastrophic event cannot make the entire human civilization go extinct. Mobilizing $50T to transition the world from scarcity to abundance by creating a $5,000T global economy by 2060. A future where we are not limited by energy, resources, money, technology, science, physical labor, and cognitive labor of human biology.

"Our purpose behind moving towards creating a world of abundance is to ensure every person on Earth gets access to healthy food, clean water, advanced medical care, education, opportunity to contribute to the growth of humanity with more meaningful jobs and stable income without any discrimination about status, money, religion, color, gender, or language. Humanity will grow together, in a better, safer, and happier world.

A world of abundance, a world of possibility, where no child dies of hunger, no one's life is lost due to the absence of advanced medical care, no family lives in darkness, no one’s dreams die just because it was born in poverty. Poverty itself must become history. No person works to fulfill their basic needs but for a greater purpose of humanity.

The beginning of a new era of humanity.

History has epochs. Fire. Steam engine. Oil. Electricity. The internet. In 2035, we will cross the greatest threshold in human history: Artificial Super Intelligence. I have architected the execution blueprint to create the $5,000T global economy by 2060 with Renokon ASI and to deliver ASI to humanity by 2035. From that moment onward, the trajectory of civilization will not merely change—it will be irreversibly transformed." — Rupayan Das, Founder & CEO, Chief ASI Architect of Renokon ASI

Renokon Sovereign ASI Partnership - The Largest Coordinated Capital Mobilization in Human History.

The opportunity to invest in Renokon Sovereign ASI Partnership will be presented to very few selected Sovereign Wealth Funds, long-horizon pension and insurance institutions, and the world’s largest asset management institutions in 2026.

By the end of the year 2026, we will sign $20T+ in long-term (10-year) investment commitment.

A Civilization Confined to One Planet will Eventually Go Extinct. The Risk of Humanity's Extinction is Real. Today, there are 6 Highly Concerning Risks, That Could Be the Reason of Humanity's Extinction:

Nuclear War: Global escalation leading to total societal collapse and uninhabitable conditions. 
Climate Collapse: Irreversible tipping points (permafrost melt, ocean acidification, global warming) rendering Earth unlivable. 
Engineered Pandemics: Lab-designed pathogens with 100% lethality and rapid spread, beyond natural containment. 
Asteroid Impact on Earth: Large-body collision causing mass extinction, as with the dinosaurs 66 million years ago. 
Single-Point-Failure Risk of Earth: Gamma-Ray burst aimed at Earth, Biodiversity loss, Clean water destabilization, Biogeochemical Flows, Ocean Acidification. 
Super Volcano: Massive eruptions causing years-long "nuclear winter" via ash and climate disruption.

We are Just One Catastrophic Event Away from Total Extinction.

Renokon ASI Rejects Extinction as Acceptable; We Accept Responsibility for Humanity's Continuation.

Change is the Only Constant, If We Don’t Evolve, We will Go extinct. Humanity will Evolve.

We are assembling the co-architects of Renokon ASI—the co-architects of the future of humanity—who are willing to take responsibility not merely for financial returns, but for continuity of civilization itself.
